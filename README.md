#  Women Destiny



Women Destiny is an iOS application developed in Swift, designed to support women in navigating their paths after motherhood. The app presents users with two choices: to embrace motherhood fully or to continue their career while managing family responsibilities. Based on the user's selection, the app redirects them to tailored content and resources.



Embrace Motherhood: Redirects to resources focused on parenting and family life.
Continue Career: Provides guidance for balancing work and motherhood.
The app utilizes structured navigation with buttons, labels, and images, implementing conditional logic using if-else statements to guide users based on their selections.
